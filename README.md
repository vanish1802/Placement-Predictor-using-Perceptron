## **Introduction**
Predicting job placements is a valuable task for educational institutions and students alike. This project uses a simple dataset containing students' CGPA and resume scores to predict whether they will be placed in a job.

---

## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is **[Job Placement Simple Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascientist97/job-placement-simple-dataset)**. It contains the following columns:
- **`cgpa`**: The student's cumulative grade point average.
- **`resume_score`**: A score reflecting the quality of the student's resume.
- **`placed`**: Target variable (1 = Placed, 0 = Not Placed).

---

## **Installation**
To run this project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone 
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

## **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Load the dataset using Pandas.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and relationships.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalize features (`cgpa` and `resume_score`) for better model performance.

3. **Model Building**:
   - A Perceptron model is used for binary classification.
   - The model is trained using `eta0=0.1`, `max_iter=100`, and `random_state=42`.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy.
   - Visualize decision boundaries for better understanding.

5. **Prediction**:
   - Use the trained model to predict whether students in new data will be placed.

---

## **Results**
- The Perceptron model achieved an accuracy of **X%** (replace with actual accuracy) on the test set.
- Decision boundaries were visualized to interpret how features influence placement predictions.
